# TODO (order of highest to lowest priority)
- JPG and BMP support
- --font-size causes top/left scaling issues
- Binary info file
  - Come up format to write, currently asserts "unimplemented"
- Clean and fuzz
  - Some values should really have a max, so come up with a solution other than & 0x800...
- Unicode (really don't care at this point)
